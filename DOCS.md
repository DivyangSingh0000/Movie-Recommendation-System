1. Executive Summary
This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the Movie Recommendation System, detailing its architecture, data processing pipeline, recommendation algorithms, and implementation specifics. The system employs multiple recommendation strategies to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and behavior patterns.

A key component of the system is the automation framework that ensures data quality and reliability through automated validation of input data before recommendation generation. This validation process checks for required files (`metadata.json`, `data.csv`) and a non-empty `assets/` directory, ensuring the system only processes complete and valid data packages.
